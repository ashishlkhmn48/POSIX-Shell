- Open terminal in same directory as Main.cpp file

- Compile the program in terminal like :
    1. make
     or
    2. g++ Main.cpp cd/cd.cpp ls/ls.cpp utility/utility.cpp back/back.cpp history/history.cpp -o Main

- Run the program like :
    ./Main

- Implemented : 
    1. ; separated commands execution
    2. cd
    3. echo
    4. pwd
    5. ls
    6. search
    7. foreground & background(&) process
    8. history
    9. exit
    10. Up Arrow for history

- Some important NOTE : 
    1. Implemented multiple directiories/files case in "ls" as per bash in MAC
    2. pinfo not implemented as bash in MAC doesnot support it
